Use Case Testing:
Use Case Testing is a black-box testing technique that focuses on testing a system's functionality based on its use cases.
1. Identify use cases based on system requirements and user interactions.
2. Define test scenarios for each use case.
3. Test each scenario to ensure the system behaves as expected.

ex:
1. Use Case: Online Shopping
    Actor: Customer
     Goal: Purchase a product
     Preconditions: Customer is logged in, product is available
      Postconditions: Order is placed, payment is processed
     Flow:
        1. Customer searches for product
        2. Customer adds product to cart
        3. Customer checks out
        4. Customer enters payment details
        5. Order is confirmed
