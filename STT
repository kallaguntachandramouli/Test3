State Transition Testing

State Transition Testing is a black-box testing technique that checks how a system behaves as it transitions between different states in response to events or inputs.

Key Elements:

 States: The different statuses or modes a system can be in (e.g., logged in, logged out, editing, saved).
Transitions: The changes from one state to another triggered by events or inputs.
 Events: Inputs or actions that trigger state transitions (e.g., clicking a button, entering data).
 Actions: Outcomes or behaviors when a transition occurs.

          |  Initial    |
          
                  |
                  | Login Attempt
                  v
               Invalid      
          |  Authenticating | ----------------> | Authentication|
              Credentials    |     Failed    |
                  |                           
                  | Valid
                  v
                Logout 

          |   Logged In    | <---------------- |  Logged Out  |
                          
                  | Logout
                  v
          
          |  Logged Out   |
