BVA is a black-box testing technique that focuses on testing boundaries of input values. It's based on the idea that errors often occur at boundaries.

-
    1.Errors often happen at boundaries (e.g., min, max, edge cases)
    2.Efficiently tests critical areas
     BVA works
    1. Identify input boundaries (min, max, invalid values)
    2. Test values at boundaries (min, max, just below/above)
    3. Test invalid values (e.g., below min, above max)

ex: password field (8-20 characters)
- BVA test cases:
       7 Characters (invalid)
       8 characters (valid)
      20 characters (valid)
       21 characters (invalid)

Equivalence Partitioning (EP)

EP is a black-box technique that divides input data into partitions based on expected behavior.

    1. Reduces test cases while maintaining coverage
    2. Tests representative values from each partition
    3. Identify input partitions (valid, invalid, edge cases)
    4. Test one representative value from each partition
ex : age field (18-100 years)
 EP partitions:
    -valid (18-100)
    -invalid (<18)
    -invalid (>100)
 EP test cases:
     25 (valid)
     17 (invalid)
    101 (invalid)
